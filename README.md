# 1. Hashing

A hash function takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, called a digest, is unique for different inputs with a very high probability.

‚Ä¢ Properties:

‚Ä¢ Deterministic: Same input always produces the same digest.

‚Ä¢ One-way: Cannot feasibly invert the digest to recover original data.

‚Ä¢ Collision-resistant: Hard to find two distinct inputs that produce the same digest.

‚Ä¢ Use Cases:

‚Ä¢ Storing passwords securely (store the digest, not the password).

‚Ä¢ Verifying file integrity (checksums).

‚Ä¢ Deduplication of data in storage systems.

<!-- Run the code -->
# node Hash

# 2. Salting

A salt is a random value added to input data before hashing. Salting prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to reverse common hashes.

‚Ä¢ Properties:

‚Ä¢ Unique per user/password.

‚Ä¢ Stored alongside the hash.

‚Ä¢ Increases entropy and ensures distinct hashes for identical inputs.

‚Ä¢ Use Cases:

‚Ä¢ Password storage in databases.

‚Ä¢ Enhancing key derivation processes for user credentials.

<!-- Run the code -->
# node Salting

# 3. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)

An HMAC combines a secret key with the message data and processes it through a hash function to produce a secure code that verifies both the integrity and authenticity of the message.

‚Ä¢ Properties:

‚Ä¢ Requires a shared secret key.

‚Ä¢ Resistant to length extension attacks (depending on the underlying hash).

‚Ä¢ Provides both integrity and authenticity.

‚Ä¢ Use Cases:

‚Ä¢ API request signing.

‚Ä¢ Secure cookie generation/validation.

‚Ä¢ Verifying messages in distributed systems.

<!-- Run the code -->
# node HMAC

# 4. Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key to both encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext.

‚Ä¢ Properties:

‚Ä¢ Fast and efficient for bulk data.

‚Ä¢ Key distribution is a challenge‚Äîboth parties must securely share the same key.

‚Ä¢ Use Cases:

‚Ä¢ Encrypting files at rest (e.g., disk encryption).

‚Ä¢ Securing network traffic in VPNs and TLS sessions.

‚Ä¢ Database field encryption.

<!-- Run the code -->
# node SymEncrypt

# 5. Key Pairs

In asymmetric cryptography, a key pair consists of a private key (kept secret) and a public key (shared openly).

‚Ä¢ Properties:

‚Ä¢ Public key encrypts or verifies signatures.

‚Ä¢ Private key decrypts or creates signatures.

‚Ä¢ Generated together and mathematically linked.

‚Ä¢ Use Cases:

‚Ä¢ Secure key exchange mechanisms.

‚Ä¢ Identity verification.

‚Ä¢ Establishing trust in certificate-based systems.

<!-- Run the code -->
# node Keypair

# 6. Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption leverages a recipient‚Äôs public key for encryption and the corresponding private key for decryption.

‚Ä¢ Properties:

‚Ä¢ Eliminates need for a shared secret channel.

‚Ä¢ Computationally more intensive than symmetric encryption.

‚Ä¢ Use Cases:

‚Ä¢ Secure email (PGP/GPG).

‚Ä¢ HTTPS/TLS handshake for negotiating session keys.

‚Ä¢ Encrypting small messages or session keys.

<!-- Run the code -->
# node AsymEncrypt

# 7. Digital Signature

A digital signature is created by hashing a message and then encrypting the digest with the sender‚Äôs private key. Recipients verify the signature using the sender‚Äôs public key.

‚Ä¢ Properties:

‚Ä¢ Authenticity: Confirms the message came from the claimed sender.

‚Ä¢ Integrity: Detects any alteration of the message.

‚Ä¢ Non-repudiation: Sender cannot deny signing.

‚Ä¢ Use Cases:

‚Ä¢ Code signing for software distribution.

‚Ä¢ Signing legal documents electronically.

‚Ä¢ Transaction validation in blockchain systems.

<!-- Run the code -->
# node DigSign

# 8. Interplay of Concepts

‚Ä¢ User Authentication: Salt + hash passwords; optionally wrap with HMAC.

‚Ä¢ Secure Channels: Use asymmetric encryption for key exchange, then symmetric encryption for bulk data.

‚Ä¢ Data Integrity & Authenticity: Apply HMACs for shared-key environments; use digital signatures in public-key contexts.
